# E-Commerce Website


This final year project is an e-commerce website developed using Django and React frameworks, with the help of React Bootstrap for styling and design. The website aims to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers with a clean and intuitive user interface.

Django, a high-level Python web framework, is used for the back-end development, providing robust security features and scalability. The back-end interacts with the database to manage products, orders, and customer information, and also handles payment processing through integration with popular payment gateways.

React, a popular JavaScript library, is used for the front-end development, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. The website is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, providing a smooth shopping experience for customers on any device.

React Bootstrap, a popular UI library, is used to design and style the website, providing a modern and professional look and feel. The website features a clean and organized layout, with easy navigation and a visually appealing design.

In conclusion, this final year project showcases the integration of Django and React frameworks to create a powerful and scalable e-commerce website, with a user-friendly design and user experience.
